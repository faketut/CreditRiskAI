2. Data Ingestion
Ingest Raw Data:

Create a FastAPI endpoint (/ingest) to accept CSV or JSON files containing customer data.

Validate the incoming data against the metadata schema (e.g., ID, Customer_ID, Age, Annual_Income, etc.).

Store the raw data in the PostgreSQL raw_data table.

Log Data Ingestion:

Log each ingestion event (e.g., file name, timestamp, number of records) in the ingestion_logs table.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Load Data for EDA:

Create a FastAPI endpoint (/eda) to fetch data from the raw_data table.

Use Python libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to perform EDA.

Generate EDA Reports:

Calculate key statistics (e.g., missing values, distributions, correlations).

Save EDA visualizations (e.g., histograms, box plots) to GCP Storage.

Store EDA summary statistics in the eda_results table.

4. Data Preprocessing
Clean and Transform Data:

Create a FastAPI endpoint (/preprocess) to fetch raw data and apply preprocessing steps:

Handle missing values (e.g., impute Annual_Income with median).

Remove duplicates and outliers.

Encode categorical variables (e.g., Credit_Mix, Payment_Behaviour).

Store the cleaned data in the processed_data table.

Log Preprocessing Steps:

Log each preprocessing step (e.g., imputation method, encoding strategy) in the preprocessing_logs table.

5. Feature Selection
Select Relevant Features:

Create a FastAPI endpoint (/select_features) to perform feature selection:

Use statistical methods (e.g., correlation analysis, chi-square test).

Select features with the highest impact on Credit_Score.

Store the selected features in the selected_features table.

Log Feature Selection:

Log the selected features and their importance scores in the feature_selection_logs table.

6. Model Development
Train the Model:

Create a FastAPI endpoint (/train) to train the credit risk model:

Split the data into training and testing sets.

Apply WOE (Weight of Evidence) transformation to categorical variables.

Train a logistic regression model using Credit_Score as the target variable.

Save the trained model to GCP Storage.

Log Model Training:

Log model training details (e.g., hyperparameters, training accuracy) in the model_training_logs table.

7. Model Validation and Calibration
Validate the Model:

Create a FastAPI endpoint (/validate) to validate the model:

Calculate metrics (e.g., ROC-AUC, precision, recall).

Perform calibration (e.g., adjust probability thresholds).

Log Validation Results:

Log validation metrics and calibration details in the model_validation_logs table.

8. Model Deployment
Deploy the Model:

Create a FastAPI endpoint (/predict) to serve predictions:

Load the trained model.

Accept customer data as input and return the predicted Credit_Score.

Store predictions in the predictions table.

Log Predictions:

Log each prediction request (e.g., input data, predicted score) in the prediction_logs table.

9. Monitoring and Reporting
Monitor Model Performance:

Create a FastAPI endpoint (/monitor) to track model performance over time:

Calculate metrics (e.g., accuracy, stability) on new data.

Generate alerts if performance drops below a threshold.

Store monitoring results in the monitoring_logs table.

Generate Reports:

Create a FastAPI endpoint (/report) to generate periodic reports:

Summarize model performance, usage statistics, and key insights.

Save reports and send them to stakeholders via email.

10. Continuous Improvement (pending)
Retrain the Model:

Create a FastAPI endpoint (/retrain) to retrain the model periodically:

Fetch new data from the raw_data table.

Repeat the preprocessing, feature selection, and training steps.

Log retraining details in the retraining_logs table.

Update the model_documentation.md file with new insights, changes, and best practices.
